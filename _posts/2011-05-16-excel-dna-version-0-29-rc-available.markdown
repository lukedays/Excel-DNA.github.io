I have posted a release candidate of Excel-DNA version 0.29 to the CodePlex site. The download is available at [http://exceldna.codeplex.com/releases/view/66405][release-0-29]. I will wait a week or two for some confirmation that this version works correctly before setting this release to "recommended" status and updating the NuGet package. Any results from your testing with this version would be very helpful.

Excel-DNA version 0.29 adds support for a number of specialized Excel features. The 64-bit version of Excel 2010 is fully supported, registration-free Custom Task Panes can be created under Excel 2007 and later, direct COM server integration can improve integration with legacy VBA code, and macros with parameters are registered. In addition, there are some features to improve the development and debugging workflow, and a few minor bugfixes. The complete change list is included below.

More information about the new features will be posted on the Excel-DNA website in the coming weeks. Any comments or questions are welcome on the Google group - [http://groups.google.com/group/exceldna][excel-dna-group] - or by contacting me directly.

As always, I greatly appreciate any feedback on this version, and on Excel-DNA in general.
