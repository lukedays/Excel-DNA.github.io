I recently noticed a very nice add-in developed by [Bryan McKelvey][bryan-mckelvey] called [FinAnSu][finansu]. The whole add-in is generously available under the MIT open source license, and is a fantastic example of what can be built with Excel-DNA.

[FinAnSu][finansu] uses a ribbon interface to make the various functions and macros easy to find. The RTD server support is used to implement asynchronous data update functions, providing a live quote feed from Bloomberg, Google or Yahoo! And then there is a bunch of useful-looking financial functions. Here's a little preview:

Find the project on Google code: [http://code.google.com/p/finansu/][finansu], with detailed documentation on the wiki: [http://code.google.com/p/finansu/wiki/Introduction][finansu-docs].

You can browse through the [source code][finansu-source] online, but to download a copy of the whole project you'll need a [Mercurial client][mercurial-client]. I just installed the one called Mercurial 1.8.2 MSI installer and ran `hg clone https://finansu.googlecode.com/hg/ finansu` from a command prompt.
