[![EQ Finance logo][eq-finance-logo]][eq-finance]
>"We migrated to Excel-DNA, which has simplified greatly our Excel interfacing. It is a superb product, superior to others we have used previously, and Govert is incredibly responsive and helpful in maintaining and improving it - Alberto Cherubini, [EQ Finance][eq-finance]

<br>

>"Excel-DNA is in use in our major locations around the world and in many mission critical scenarios. Usage covers the full gamut of features from simple UDF add-ins to managing real-time trading flow, interacting with order management systems. The open source Excel-DNA project is incredibly useful to us. Thanks very much to Govert and contributors." - Paul Gresham, Hong Kong.

>"I have never programmed with Excel and Excel-DNA allowed me build Calcbench's Excel Add-In in two weeks." - Andrew Kittredge, [Calcbench][calcbench].

<br>

[![XBRLAnalyst logo][xbrlanalyst-logo]][findynamics]
>"Excel-DNA is incredibly versatile and stable framework for building Excel add-ins and user-defined functions. With such a pivotal element in our project, we were very concerned about committing to Excel-DNA that was developed by an enthusiast. However, we quickly learned that Govert has created an outstanding open source project; that he is keen on helping with any challenging questions and that the community is active enough to sustain a healthy evolution of Excel-DNA." - Ilya Vadeiko, [FinDynamics][findynamics]

<br>

>"Excel-DNA is the open source project that quietly delivers a robust and simple to use extensibility framework for Microsoft Excel. When we felt we had outgrown VBA, no longer wanted the complexity of C++ and were thoroughly fed up with VSTO, Excel-DNA seemed a great choice and we haven't been let down.
